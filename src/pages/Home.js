           <h1>1,500</h1>
           <p>We were able tro serve approximately 1,500 kids our curated gift bags. Out of 10,000+ toys and 2,000+ books, we were left with only 1,000 or so items which went into the caring hands of Celebration Nation.</p>
           <h1>1,000</h1>
           <p>Not to mention we were able to feed over 1,000 people at the event at Burgerlords. </p>
           <h1>$50,000</h1>
           <p>One of our main goals of the Toy Giveaway was to give toys that focused on child development without promoting gender biases. We were only able to do this because of our donors who contributed over $50,000 to make it happen.</p>
